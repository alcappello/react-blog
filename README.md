# React + Redux Weather application

This small application is part of the code written while I attended [a great course](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/) on React and Redux.


## Getting Started
Checkout this repo, install dependencies, then start the gulp process with the following:

```
> git clone https://github.com/alcappello/ReactWeather.git
> cd ReduxWeather
> npm install
> npm start
```
